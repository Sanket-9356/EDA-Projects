# 📊 Banking Fraud Detection Analysis (EDA)


## 📌 Project Overview  
In today’s financial world, **credit score assessment** is crucial for financial institutions to reduce risks, avoid loan defaults, and provide personalized financial products.  

This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of customer financial data to **analyze, classify, and predict credit scores** based on factors such as **income, debt, credit card usage, and payment behavior**.  

The case study is inspired by **Paisabazaar**, a financial services company that helps individuals access loans and credit products.  



## 🎯 Business Objectives  

- 🔐 **Enhance Credit Risk Management**  
  Improve credit score classification to minimize bad debt and reduce risks.  

- 🏦 **Personalize Product Recommendations**  
  Offer tailored credit cards, loans, and financial services based on customer profiles.  

- ⚡ **Streamline Loan Approvals**  
  Automate credit score predictions for faster loan decision-making.  

- 🤝 **Improve Customer Satisfaction**  
  Provide personalized and accurate financial advice to build customer trust.  



## 🔎 Data Analysis Performed  

### 1️⃣ Univariate Analysis  
- 📈 **Age Distribution**: Identify dominant customer age groups.  
- 💰 **Annual Income & Monthly Salary**: Evaluate financial health and affordability.  
- 📊 **Credit Score Categories**: Distribution of Good, Standard, and Poor categories (class imbalance).  
- 📦 **Credit Utilization Ratio**: Detect outliers and high-risk overleveraged customers.  
- 💸 **Interest Rates**: Understand borrowing cost variations.  

### 2️⃣ Bivariate Analysis  
- 👤 **Age vs Credit Score** → Box plot  
- 💵 **Income vs Credit Score** → Violin plot  
- 🏷️ **Number of Loans vs Credit Score** → Stacked bar chart  
- ⏳ **Delay from Due Date vs Credit Score** → Scatter/Box plots  
- 👔 **Occupation vs Credit Score** → Bar plot  

### 3️⃣ Multivariate Analysis  
- 🔗 **Pair Plot** → Annual Income, Outstanding Debt, Credit Utilization Ratio, Credit History Age, Credit Score  
- 🌡️ **Correlation Heatmap** → Relationships between numerical features such as debt, utilization, and credit cards  



## 🛠️ Tech Stack  

- 🐍 **Language**: Python  
- 📦 **Libraries**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- 💻 **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook 




## 📈 Outcomes  

- ✅ Identified risky financial behaviors (delayed payments, high utilization).  
- ✅ Found correlations between income, loans, and credit scores.  
- ✅ Created insights that support **predictive modeling for credit risk analysis**.  



## 🌟 Future Scope  

- 🤖 Build **Machine Learning models** to predict credit scores.  
- 📊 Develop a **dashboard** for real-time insights.  
- 🔍 Extend analysis to **fraud detection in live banking transactions**.
