# 📦 UPS Logistics Performance Analysis (EDA)

This project is an **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** of UPS (United Parcel Service) shipment data. It focuses on uncovering patterns and insights that can help **optimize logistics operations**, **reduce freight costs**, and **improve delivery performance** in a fast-paced, eCommerce-driven market.

---

## 🚀 Project Objective

To help UPS enhance its global supply chain efficiency by analyzing key operational data and answering questions like:

- Which regions contribute most to shipment volume?
- What modes of transport are most cost-effective?
- Where are the delays and inefficiencies occurring?
- Which vendors have higher freight costs relative to item value?

---

## 📁 Dataset Overview

The dataset contains detailed information on UPS shipment records, including:

- **Shipment Mode** (Ground, Air, Express)
- **Origin & Destination Countries**
- **Shipment & Delivery Dates**
- **Vendor Information**
- **Shipment Weight & Quantity**
- **Item Value**
- **Freight Cost**
- **Delivery Delays**

> *Note: This is a simulated/cleansed dataset for academic and portfolio use.*

## 🔍 EDA Highlights

### 📌 Univariate Analysis
- **Top Shipment Countries**: Identify high-volume regions
- **Mode of Transport Distribution**: Analyze usage patterns of Ground, Air, Express
- **Freight Cost Distribution**: Detect outliers and high-cost regions
- **Shipment Weight & Item Quantity**: Understand load profiles and frequency
- **Top Vendors by Shipment Count**: Track major partners

### 📌 Bivariate Analysis
- **Average Weight by Mode**
- **Delivery Delays by Mode**
- **Shipments Over Time** (seasonality analysis)
- **Shipment Value vs Mode**

### 📌 Multivariate Analysis
- **Freight Cost vs Country, Mode, Vendor**
- **Item Value vs Freight Cost per Mode**
- **Correlation Heatmap**: Cost, delay, weight, and performance
- **Pair Plot**: Cluster detection for shipments with similar traits
